# Browser support

Remount supports all modern browsers, including IE11 (Internet Explorer's oldest supported version as of 2016). Remember to use the polyfills below to ensure the best compatibility.

As of August 2018, IE10 only has [0.09%](https://caniuse.com/usage-table) usage share. Microsoft ended official support for IE10 on [January 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_10).
